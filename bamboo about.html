            <h1><font size="20" color="green">Current Focus</font></h1>
            <p>AEPL has identified two primary crops for exploration: Bamboo and Jackfruit. In the initial two years, our focus is on Bamboo. We plan to establish a Biochar unit with a daily production capacity of 120 tons, processing 500 tons of bamboo using state-of-the-art technology. Talks are underway with Indian and European companies for technology transfers to produce Biochar and create organic manures fortified by Biochar.

                <br>In the first phase, we propose to establish a bamboo plantation covering 317 acres of land in Chincholi, Gulbarga district, Karnataka. Over the next two years, our ambitious plan is to expand the bamboo plantation to 2,000 acres.
                
                <br>At AEPL, we believe in fostering sustainable agricultural practices and creating a brighter future for farmers. Join us on this exciting journey as we pave the way for a prosperous destination in agriculture.</p>

            <h1><font size="20" color="green">About Bamboo</font></h1>
            <p>Bamboo, a versatile woody grass from the family Poaceae, stands out for its rapid growth, strength, and ecological benefits. With tall, slender culms, it plays a vital role in environmental conservation by quickly regenerating after harvesting. Rich in cultural heritage, bamboo finds applications in construction, textiles, and more.</p>
            <h1><font size="20" color="green">Bamboo In India</font></h1>
            <p>India boasts around 136 bamboo species, culturally significant and economically important. Distributed across states, particularly in the northeast, bamboo holds a crucial place in traditional practices, providing raw materials for various industries.</p>
